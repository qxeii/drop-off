Drop-off! is a port of qxeii's Quilt mod, Re-Disruption to Fabric. You can find it here --> https://github.com/qxeii/redisruption/tree/master
It applys physics to blocks, allowing them to fall if they have no support. This can make for some intresting interactions in the world. Trees can be felled by only mining the bottom block. Mining one suspened block can cause many others to fall. Building a quick bridge across a large gap is no longer fessible, as it requires supports.
